# Weather App

https://umutweatherapp.netlify.app/

## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance and demonstrate my skills in working with APIs by developing a web application that fetches and displays weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the `axios` library and `async/await` for API requests. This project serves as a practical application to showcase my proficiency in using `axios`, `async/await`, and `fetch` for API requests. The application provides weather information based on the user's location and allows searching for weather data of a specific city.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and enhancing the visual aspects of the app.
- **Bootstrap**: Integrated for responsive design and layout components.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for handling API requests and displaying data using `axios` and `async/await`. Key JavaScript features include:
  - Fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using `axios`
  - Using `async/await` for asynchronous operations
  - Handling errors and displaying error messages to the user
  - Using `navigator.geolocation` API to get user's location
  - Displaying weather information based on user's location and input city
  - Language selection feature (English and German) using API support

### APIs Used
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather information based on location and input city.
  - API link: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### At the end of the project, will be able to;

This project has significantly contributed to my understanding and mastery of working with APIs in JavaScript. By developing this weather application, I have gained practical experience in making asynchronous API requests, handling geolocation data, and dynamically updating the DOM with the fetched data. Additionally, I have improved my ability to handle errors and provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
